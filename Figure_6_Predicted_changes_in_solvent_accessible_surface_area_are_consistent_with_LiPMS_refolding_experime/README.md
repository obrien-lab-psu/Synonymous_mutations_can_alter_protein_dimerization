The four PDB structures in this directory were used to generate the structures in Fig 6 e & f:

1yta_a_xray_all-atom.pdb: all-atom reference structure, used to generate structures labeled "Native"
                          in 6e &f

1yta_sampled_backmapped_1_rebuilt.pdb: a representative structure for orn State 0 (see MSM clustering in Methods and software directory)
                                       used to generate the State 0 structure in 6e

1yta_sampled_backmapped_6_rebuilt.pdb: a representative structure for orn State 1 used to generate State 1 images
                                       in 6e and 6f

1yta_sampled_backmapped_27_rebuilt.pdb: a representative structure of orn State 5 (which does not contain an entanglement)
                                        used to generate the State 5 image in 6f
