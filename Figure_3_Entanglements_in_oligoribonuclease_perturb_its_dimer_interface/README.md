The structures in backmapped_structures/ were generated using the code found at https://github.com/orgs/obrien-lab/

The files in backmapped_structures/ and reference_structures/ were used to generate the visualizations of entanglements
in Figure 3 as noted below:

Figure 3b: backmapped_structures/m3_1yta_fast_frame16_B_ent_aa.pdb aligned to reference_structures/1yta_b_xray_all-atom.pdb

Figure 3c: backmapped_structures/d4_1yta_fast_frame16_ent_aa.pdb aligned to reference_structures/1yta_xray_all-atom.pdb

Figure 3d & 3e: backmapped_structures/d5_1yta_fast_frame74_ent_aa.pdb aligned to reference_structures/1yta_xray_all-atom.pdb

Figure 3i & j: backmapped_structures/d5_1yta_fast_frame74_ent_aa_chainA.pdb aligned to reference_structures/1yta_a_xray_all-atom.pdb
               backmapped_structures/d5_1yta_fast_frame74_ent_aa_chainB.pdb aligned to reference_structures/1yta_b_xray_all-atom.pdb

               RMSD values in panel i were calculated in Visual Molecular Dynamics using 1yta_a_xray_all-atom.pdb or 1yta_b_xray_all-atom.pdb as the
	       reference and only C-alpha atoms considered during the alignment.
